# Godot Freecam Plugin

Often when I'm creating levels or playing with shaders, I need to see for myself how the thing looks in play mode. But I cannot be bothered to create a player of sorts in every project!

That's why I created this custom node that serves as a debug Camera3D. It's like a **freecam hack for free!** 

## Usage

The plugin provides a custom node called `DebugCamera`. You can add it via the traditional node menu.

- Turn the movement on/off with `Tab`
- Move using `WASD`
- Fly up and down with `Space` / `Shift`
- You can change your flying speed with the mouse scroll wheel.

## Roadmap

Here's some features I'm thinking of adding

- [ ] Reset - come back to the original place when freecam is turned off again
- [ ] Add camera editor gizmo
- [ ] Configure your own toggle key (currently hardcoded `Tab`)
